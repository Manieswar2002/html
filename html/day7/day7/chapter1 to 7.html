    <h3 id="chapter4">Yash Gowda</h3>
    <p>Naveen Kumar Gowda (born 8 January 1986), well known by his screen name Yash, is an Indian actor who
        predominantly works in Kannada films. His career began in Television and landed in cinema. He is a recipient of
        three Filmfare Awards South and two SIIMA awards.[1][2][3]

        Yash began his career with appearances in several television series in the 2000s. He made his film debut in 2007
        with Jambada Hudugi. The 2008 romantic drama Moggina Manasu, for which he received the Filmfare Award for Best
        Supporting Actor, proved to be a breakthrough role for Yash. His first film in a leading role, Rocky (2008), was
        poorly received by critics and a box office flop[citation needed]. He followed it up with a series of romance
        films that were commercial successes and received his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor nomination for Drama
        in 2012.

        Yash went on to establish himself as a leading actor of Kannada cinema with the college romance Googly (2013),
        comedy-drama Raja Huli (2013), fantasy action Gajakesari (2014), romantic comedy Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari (2014),
        action film Masterpiece (2015) and action romance Santhu Straight Forward (2016). Mr. and Mrs. Ramachari ranks
        among the highest-grossing Kannada releases and gave Yash his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The pan-India
        success of Prashanth Neel's 2018 period action film K.G.F: Chapter 1, which became the highest-grossing Kannada
        film, helped Yash attain nationwide recognition in India and win his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor. He
        won further praise for his performance in the sequel, K.G.F: Chapter 2 (2022), which currently ranks as the
        fourth highest-grossing Indian film worldwide and second highest-grosser in India.

        Yash promotes various social and philanthropic causes through the Yasho Marga Foundation. He is married to the
        actress Radhika Pandit. Yashomarga is a charitable foundation established by Kannada film star Yash and his wife
        Radhika Pandit.Yash was born on 8 January 1986 in Boovanahalli, a village in Hassan, Karnataka.[5][6] He was
        given two names: Naveen legally, and his mother's side of the family named him Yashwanth.[7][a] Yashwanth was
        chosen as they believed his time of birth astrologically necessitated a name beginning with the letter ಯ
        (ya).[9] In keeping with a Hindu tradition of giving children a deity's epithet, Yash was described as
        Nanjundeshwara ("poison-drinker god", referring to Shiva).[9][10] Before starting his acting career, he was
        advised by others in the industry to adopt a stage name.[11] Desiring to stand out with a name that was unique
        for an actor in Karnataka, he shortened Yashwanth to Yash.
        Yash's father, Arun Kumar Gowda, was a driver for the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation and later the
        Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation. His mother, Pushpa, is a homemaker.[13][14] He has a younger
        sister, Nandini, who is married to a computer engineer.[14] Yash aspired to be an actor from a young age and
        actively participated in theatre and dance competitions at his school in Mysore.[13] When he was young, his
        family also ran a provision store, where he would help out regularly.[15] Yash wanted to quit school and pursue
        full-time acting after completing grade 10 but had to complete senior school on the demand of his parents.[13]
        He studied at the Mahajana Education Society for all his school years.[16] His parents initially disapproved of
        his acting ambitions, and his father wanted him to be a government officer.[15] In 2003, they relented and
        allowed him to move to Bangalore at the age of 16 to work on a film as an assistant director, but stated that he
        would not be allowed to go back if he returned.[13] The project was cancelled after only two days of filming,
        but Yash stayed in Bangalore.[13] He stated he had ₹300 (equivalent to ₹1,100 or US$13 in 2023) with him at the
        time.[15] He joined a theatre group, the Benaka drama troupe, which was formed by dramatist B. V. Karanth.[17]
        He worked as a backstage worker and was paid ₹50 (60¢ US) per day
